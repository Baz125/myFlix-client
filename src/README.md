Used Parcel to create the initial app.
Problem - parcel was not available from the command line. Solution: added location of npm as a global environemnt variable in Windows
Problem - no CSS file was created with parcel output. I manually installed sass, but that didn't work, added ["dev": "parcel index.html"] to package.json... still no joy.
